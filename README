Do you envy Sublime Text 2's multiple selection and editing feature? This plugin tries to fill that text cursor shaped gap in your heart by letting you specify "regions" of text and edit them all from one place. 

USAGE 
Add edit-regions by using <leader>m in visual mode or <leader>mm in normal mode (selects the word under the cursor). You can also add disposable markers using <leader>mi (before cursor) and <leader>ma (after cursor).

Once all the regions are set, start editing with <leader>M (or <leader>C which will clear the main region before you start editing).

When you're done, leave insert mode and it will copy the changes to all other regions.

KEY MAPS 

    " Insert a disposable marker after the cursor
    nmap <leader>ma :MultieditAddMark a<CR>

    " Insert a disposable marker before the cursor
    nmap <leader>mi :MultieditAddMark i<CR>

    " Make a new line and insert a marker
    nmap <leader>mo o<Esc>:MultieditAddMark i<CR>
    nmap <leader>mO O<Esc>:MultieditAddMark i<CR>

    " Insert a marker at the end/start of a line
    nmap <leader>mA $:MultieditAddMark a<CR>
    nmap <leader>mI ^:MultieditAddMark i<CR>

    " Make the current selection/word an edit region
    vmap <leader>m :MultieditAddRegion<CR>  
    nmap <leader>mm viw:MultieditAddRegion<CR>

    " Restore the regions from a previous edit session
    nmap <leader>mu :MultieditRestore<CR>

    " Move cursor between regions n times
    map ]m :MultieditHop 1<CR>
    map [m :MultieditHop -1<CR>

    " Start editing!
    nmap <leader>M :Multiedit<CR>

    " Clear the word and start editing
    nmap <leader>C :Multiedit!<CR>

    " Unset the region under the cursor
    nmap <silent> <leader>md :MultieditClear<CR>

    " Unset all regions
    nmap <silent> <leader>mr :MultieditReset<CR>

CUSTOMIZING

    " Disable all mappings? (So you can set your own)
    let g:multiedit_no_mappings = 0

    " Reset all regions on InsertLeave when finished?
    let g:multiedit_auto_reset = 1

    " Disposable marker character (beware characters with strlen > 1 - like
    " special/unicode symbols - they don't work).
    let g:multiedit_mark_character = '|'

    " If no selections are present and you initiate edit mode, should it
    " restore the previous regions?
    let g:multiedit_auto_restore = 1

The highlight regions can be customized, these are the defaults:
    hi default link MultieditRegions Search
    hi default link MultieditFirstRegion IncSearch
